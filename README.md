# CasperArt – Low-Cost NFT Platform for Emerging Artists

CasperArt is a concept-stage NFT platform designed to empower emerging artists by enabling low-cost NFT minting and on-chain creator ownership using the Casper Network.

## Problem
High gas fees, complex tools, and lack of copyright protection prevent many artists—especially from developing regions—from participating in the NFT ecosystem.

## Solution
CasperArt leverages Casper’s Proof-of-Stake blockchain to allow artists to mint NFTs (not mine) with minimal fees while permanently recording creator wallet address, artwork metadata, and timestamp on-chain.

## How It Works
1. Artist connects a Casper-compatible wallet
2. Artwork is uploaded with basic metadata
3. NFT is minted on the Casper blockchain
4. Ownership and authorship are recorded on-chain
5. NFT appears in the artist’s wallet as proof of ownership

## Ownership Verification
Creator ownership is verified through immutable on-chain metadata linked to the artist’s wallet address. This record serves as transparent and tamper-proof proof of authorship.

## Current Status
Concept and design stage. No smart contracts deployed yet.

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: NFT minting interface on Casper Testnet
- Phase 2: Marketplace and creator royalties
- Phase 3: Copyright protection and AI duplicate detection
- Phase 4: Ecosystem expansion and partnerships
